### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you are local to the Eugene, Oregon area, please feel free to say hi. And I always welcome constructive criticism.

I mostly work with Python, Go, backend JavaScript (Node/Express), Ansible, Shell, etc.

I also dabble with Golang, Ruby, Swift, and so on.

Despite being a "UNIX Guy", I used to do a ton of C#/.net/ASP.net.
