### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a network engineer and programmer that manages a large amount of stuff in a large education network.

If you are local to the Eugene, Oregon area, please feel free to say hi. And I always welcome constructive criticism on my commits.

I primarily work with:
- Cisco junk (IOS * and AireOS)
- Juniper
- Fortigate
- Python
- Go
- JavaScript (mostly backend Node/Express)
- Ansible
- shell
- Powershell
- Graylog
- SQL
- Active Directory

I also dabble with Ruby, Swift, and so on.

Despite being a "UNIX Guy", I used to do a ton of C#/.net/ASP.net.
