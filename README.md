### Hi there 👋

I am a network engineer and programmer that manages a lot of stuff in a large education network.

If you are local to the Eugene, Oregon area, please feel free to say hi. And I always welcome constructive criticism on my commits.

I primarily work with:
- 🤬 Cisco junk (IOS * and AireOS)
- 🌲 Juniper
- 🔥 Fortigate
- 🐍 Python
- 🐚 shell
- 🦫 Go
- 🕸️ JavaScript (mostly backend Node/Express)
- 🪵 Graylog
- 🕵🏻‍♂️ APIs and API reverse engineering
- 🤖 Ansible
- 🔋 Powershell
- 📈 SQL
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Active Directory

I also dabble with Ruby (regular and Rails), Swift, and so on.

Despite being a "UNIX Guy", I used to do some Windows stuff!
- Do a ton of C#/.net/ASP.NET, primarily building backend management websites and low-level LDAP code (most of System.DirectoryServices didn't exist back then).
- Write misc apps, including video game "trainers" in C++ (MFC, etc).
- Built business apps in Visual Basic and Access. 😅
